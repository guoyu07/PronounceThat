# PronounceThat
Text to speech Android app. You input a word or phrase, and it says it out loud. 

It is a small personal project I created to help me on english pronunciation, as part of my studies on it. More specifically, while reading articles and news out loud (it's a very effective way to improve your communication skills, by the way) I sometimes had doubt on how to correcly pronounce something, so this app comes to help. 

It uses Android's own text to speech engine, which may vary from vendor to vendor. It works for any language pack that is currently available, and whenever possible downloads new language packs - for example, suppose you want to hear something in Japanse, but never used Japanse before on your device.
